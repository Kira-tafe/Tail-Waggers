          <br>
          <p>
            At Tail Waggers, we understand that your pets are more than just
            animals—they’re family. That’s why we’re dedicated to providing the
            highest level of care, love, and attention to your furry, friends
            while you’re away.
          </p>

            Started in 2017, Tail Waggers was born out of a joy for
            animals and a commitment to ensuring their well-being. I
            started this journey with a simple mission: to offer a reliable,
            loving, and safe pet sitting service that pet owners can trust. With
            years of experience, I've grown into a trusted name in the pet
            sitting community.
